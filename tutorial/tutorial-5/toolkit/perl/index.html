    <h1>Perl Support</h1>
    
    Right now there is not a whole lot here, but this should
    eventually be a tutorial for using all the various perl modules,
    including how to embed perl directly within the net-snmp agent
    (similar to how mod_perl support allows you to embed perl directly
    into the apache web server).
    <p>
      For the time being, I'll offer <a href="perl_module.pl">a perl
      module source code</a> which can be used as a perl SNMP agent,
      perl subagent, or sourced directly within a agent containing
      embedded perl support.  To make it work directly within your
      agent, you must have compiled the net-snmp package using
      --enable-embedded-perl and then in your snmpd.conf file you can
      put:
    <ul>
	perl do "<a href="perl_module.pl">/path/to/perl_module.pl</a>";
    </ul>
