    <h1>MFD: IF-MIB</h1>
    <p><em>NOTE: this tutorial is based on the code for the upcoming release
        5.2 (currently in the main CVS line). If you generate code from a
        release prior to 5.2, your results may vary.</em>

      This tutorial documents the process of implementing the
      <var>IF-MIB</var> MIB module for Linux. We'll start with the
      <var>ifTable</var>, and then do the <var>ifXTable</var>.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The data for both of these tables comes from the kernel. This means
      that we have to explicity ask for the data, the data may not be
      in the format we would like it to be in, and all the data we want may
      not be available. It also means that we will not be notified when the
      data changes.
    </p><p>
      We cannot really do anything about the format of the data that we get
      from the kernel. The ifXTable presenta an additional twist, in that it
      contains 64 bit counters for statistics, and the statistics available
      for the Linux 2.4 kernels are only 32 bits. So we'll  cache data and
      do periodic polls to maintaine these values.
    </p><p>
      As is often the case with external data, the interfaces data we get
      from the kernel is not sorted by the index specified by the MIB. The
      kernel reports data by interface names ('eth0', 'lo', etc), and the
      <var>IF-MIB</var> tables specifies an integer, <var>ifIndex</var>, as
      the table index.
    </p>
