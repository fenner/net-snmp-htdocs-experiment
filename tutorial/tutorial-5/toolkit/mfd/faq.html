    <h1>MFD : Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>
      One of the stengths of the MIBs for Dummies configuration file
      is also one of its weakenesses: flexibility. There are many
      different customizations that can be made to the code. Hopefully
      this document can help provide some guidance on when you might
      want to choose one option over another.

    <h3>How do I customize the generated code?</h3>
    <p>
      There are two ways to control how mib2c generates code. One is via
      command line arguments, and the other is via configuration files.
      Both methods are covered on the <a href="options.html">MFD options</a>
      page.

    <h3>How can I re-generated code for my table without losing my changes?</h3>
    <p>
      There is no method that will gurantee a smooth transition, but if the
      code templates have not changed to radically, it is a fairly simple
      process. There is even a shell script to automate the process. Details
      can be found on the <a href="../mib2c/mib2c-update.html">mib2c-update</a>
      page.

    <h3>When should I initialize the data context?</h3>
    <p>
      When a request is received for a particular table, the indexes for
      the table must be loaded to determine a row can be found to respond
      to the request. Initializing the data context, however, can be
      delayed until the data for a particular row is needed. So, how do
      you decide when to initialize the data context?
    </p><p>
      That depends on several issues, including how fast you can access
      your data, how much data you have, whether or not you are caching
      your data, and how you expect your data to be accessed.
    </p><p>
      Initialize the data context while the indexes are being initialized
      if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have a small data set such that initializing the data context
        has a negligible impact on load time
      <li>your data changes rapidly and you want requests within the cache
        timeout to use data from the same timeframe or sample set. (eg during
        a snmpwalk of the table).
    </ul>
    <p>
      Delay initialization of the data context until the data is needed if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>you do not care about data from different timeframes or sample sets
        being used for requests (eg during a snmpwalk of the table).
      <li>you always want the freshest, most recent data to answer requests
      <li>you have an extremely large data set, and initializing the data
        context impacts performance, or requires excessive amounts of memory
    </ul>

    <h3>Do I really have to load all the indexes?</h3>
    <p>
      The idea behind the MFD templates is to require as little SNMP
      knowledge as possible. However, if you have the SNMP knowleged
      and want to make some optimizations, we will point you in the
      right direction. We might not be as sympathetic when you run into
      problems, though.
    </p><p>
      SNMP requests fall into one of two categories: requests that specify
      a specific object (SnmpGet, SnmpSet), and those that don't
      (SnmpGetNext, SnmpGetBulk).
