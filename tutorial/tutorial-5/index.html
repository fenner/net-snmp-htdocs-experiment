<p><b><font size="+1">Note Well:</font></b>: Most of these tutorials have been replaced by wiki versions of the same tutorials and most of these pages are now out of date by comparison.  Please see the <font size="+1"><a href="{{ site.subdir }}/wiki/index.php/Tutorials">wiki Tutorials</a></font> instead.

<p><b>Note: This tutorial is for net-snmp 5.0 and above. The commands you see here will likely not work with the ucd-snmp toolkit commands. The tutorial for the <a href="../tutorial-4">older ucd-snmp</a>
is still available, however.</b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to the net-snmp tutorial series. Here we hope to present to you various different tutorials that will help you learn all about the net-snmp package. This tutorial is <b>not</b> intended to
be a replacement for the fine <a href="#Documentation">manual pages</a> and other documentation (<a href="{{ site.subdir }}/docs/FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a>, etc). The tutorial gets more complex as you go on,
so stop reading when get beyond what you really wish to know.</p>
<p>Currently, we do assume you understand at least a little bit about SNMP. Future tutorials will be written to address this need as well, hopefully.</p>
<h3>The Tutorial</h3>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="commands/index.html">net-snmp command set</a> section will teach you all about the net-snmp command toolset and how to use the wonderful commands like snmpget, snmpwalk, snmpset,
etc...</li>
<li>The <a href="mrtg/index.html">mrtg</a> section has some notes on using <a href="http://www.mrtg.org/">The Multi-Router Traffic Grapher"</a> with the net-snmp demon</li>
<li>The <b>net-snmp <a href="demon">demon</a></b> section (not finished) will explain how to use and run your net-snmp snmpd and snmptrapd programs.</li>
<li>The <a href="toolkit/index.html">net-snmp toolkit</a> section will get down to the nuts and bolts of using the net-snmp libraries to build an example SNMP application, agent mib module, and stand
alone sub-agent. (Knowledge of C required).</li>
<li>The <a href="{{ site.subdir }}/dev/agent/">API manuals</a> are also extremely helpful.</li>
</ol>
