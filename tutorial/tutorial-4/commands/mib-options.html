    <h1>UCD-SNMP Tutorial -- Using local MIBs</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b>  Much of this tutorial requires <a
	href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/net-snmp/ucd-snmp-4.2.6.tar.gz">ucd-snmp-4.2.2 or higher</a>!,
	so make sure you get it before running the commands found in
	this tutorial.</b> 
      <p><b>Note:</b>  A new tutorial for net-snmp 5.0 and above <a
      href="/tutorial-5">is available</a> as well.  The commands is
      the ucd-snmp specific tutorial will not work as expected if you
      are using net-snmp and not ucd-snmp.
      <br><br>
    <hr>

    <p>
      The ucd-snmp tools can translate numeric object identifies
      (OIDs) into textual object identifiers using the MIB description
      files.  The ucd-snmp toolkit provides a few of the standard
      MIBs, but certainly doesn't contain all the MIBs known to man.

    <p>
      First off, you should know about the paths that the tools load
      MIBs from.  By default, it loads things from the following list
      of directories:

    <ol>
      <li> $HOME/.snmp/mibs
      <li> /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs
    </ol>

    <p>
      So, lets say you have a MIB called <a
      href="ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/CISCO-RHINO-MIB.my">CISCO-RHINO-MIB</a>
      that you want parsed (it really exists, and I particularly liked
      the name so I'm using it in the tutorial).  Place the file in
      one of the above two directories.  If you pulled it from another
      file (like an RFC), make sure it doesn't contain anything
      non-MIB related (like the text leading up to it, and the page
      separators).  The very first line in the file should begin with
      something like "CISCO-RHINO-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN"

    <p>
      No, pick a node in the file that you want to translate that
      currently isn't being translated.  From the CISCO-RHINO-MIB, I'll
      pick the <i>ciscoLS1010ChassisFanLed</i> node.

    <p>First, lets verify that our handy snmptranslate command
      (discussed <a href="snmptranslate.html">earlier</a>) doesn't
      yet know about this node:

<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmptranslate -IR ciscoLS1010ChassisFanLed</b>
Unknown object identifier: ciscoLS1010ChassisFanLed
</ul>
</pre>

    <p>Nope, it doesn't.  So, first we need to download the <a
      href="ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/CISCO-RHINO-MIB.my">CISCO-RHINO-MIB.my</a>
      file and place it in a directory that our snmp tools can find it
      in.  So, I'm going to place the file in $HOME/.snmp/mibs.

    <p>Now, lets use the <i>-m</i> flag to snmptranslate to tell it to
    load that mib.  We'll use "-m +CISCO-RHINO-MIB" to indicate that
    we want the tool to load not only the default set of mibs, but the
    CISCO-RHINO-MIB as well (the leading '+' plus means "also").

    <pre>
    <ul>
<b>snmptranslate -m +CISCO-RHINO-MIB -IR ciscoLS1010ChassisFanLed</b>
Cannot find module (CISCO-SMI): At line 31 in $HOME/.snmp/mibs/CISCO-RHINO-MIB.my
Unlinked OID in CISCO-RHINO-MIB: ciscoLS1010ChassisMIB ::= { workgroup 11 }
Cannot adopt OID in CISCO-RHINO-MIB: ciscoAtmSwitchInvalidCellHeader ::= { ciscoAtmSwitchInvalidCellHeaderEntry 2 }
<i>... rest of output truncated ...</i>
    </ul>
  </pre>

    <p>
    Wait a minute...  What the heck is all that stuff?  Errors!  Well,
    the first line is the most important and it's telling us that we're
    missing the CISCO-SMI MIB as well.  So, if we go <a
    href="ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/CISCO-SMI.my">download that
    MIB file</a> and place it in our $HOME/.snmp/mibs directory as
    well the command should suddenly work:

    <pre>
    <ul>
<b>snmptranslate -m +CISCO-RHINO-MIB -IR ciscoLS1010ChassisFanLed</b>
.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.5.11.1.1.12
    </ul>
  </pre>


    <p>
      <b>Success!</b>


    <p>One last comment: You can also force loading of a given MIB and
    its node in one fell swoop (and this method is the one most highly
    recommended by Niels Baggesen, one of our primary core
    developers):

    <pre>
    <ul>
<b>snmptranslate CISCO-RHINO-MIB::ciscoLS1010ChassisFanLed</b>
.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.5.11.1.1.12
    </ul>
  </pre>

    <p>So, there you have it.  A complete example for how to get your
    own <i>insert-spiffy-mib-here</i> loaded into the net-snmp tools.
