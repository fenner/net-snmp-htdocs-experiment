      The <b>snmpget</b> command can be used to retrieve data from a
      remote host given its host name, authentication information and
      an OID.  As a simple example:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget test.net-snmp.org demopublic system.sysUpTime.0</b>
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (586731977) 67 days, 21:48:39.77
</ul>
</pre>
    <p>
      In the above example, <i>test.net-snmp.org</i> is the host name
      we wanted to talk to, using the SNMP community string
      <i>demopublic</i> and we requested the value of the OID
      <i>system.sysUpTime.0</i>.

    <p>
      All of the ucd-snmp utilities use SNMPv1 by default and expects
      the community name to follow the host name.  SNMPv2c, which is
      similar in nature to SNMPv1 with small modifications, still used 
      clear-text community names as "passwords" to authenticate the
      issuer of the command.  The result from a command using the
      SNMPv2c version would have been the same:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 2c test.net-snmp.org demopublic system.sysUpTime.0</b>
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (586752671) 67 days, 21:52:06.71
</ul>
</pre>
    <p>
      All of the utilities allow abbreviation of the OIDs and do
      random searches by default, and hence you can only specify a
      small portion of the oid if you would prefer:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 2c test.net-snmp.org demopublic sysUpTime.0</b>
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (586752671) 67 days, 21:52:06.71
</ul>
</pre>
    <p>
      A common mistake when using the snmpget command is to leave off
      the index into the data you're looking for.  In the above
      commands, the variable requested by the OID is a scalar and the
      index to scalars is always a simple '0' (zero), hence the
      trailing '.0' in all the oids above.  If you had left it off,
      you would have gotten an error.  Note that the errrors differ
      slightly between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 1 test.net-snmp.org demopublic sysUpTime</b>
Error in packet
Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime
% <b>snmpget -v 2c test.net-snmp.org demopublic sysUpTime</b>
system.sysUpTime = No Such Instance currently exists
</ul>
</pre>
    <p>
      Multiple variables can be retrieved in one transaction as well:
<pre>
<ul>
% <b>snmpget -v 2c test.net-snmp.org demopublic sysUpTime.0 ucdDemoUserList.0</b>
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (586903243) 67 days, 22:17:12.43
enterprises.ucdavis.ucdDemoMIB.ucdDemoMIBObjects.ucdDemoPublic.ucdDemoUserList.0 = " noAuthUser MD5User MD5DESUser SHAUser SHADESUser"
</ul>
</pre>
