    <center><h1>UCD-SNMP Tutorial -- Commands</h1></center>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b>  Much of this tutorial requires <a
        href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/net-snmp/ucd-snmp-4.2.6.tar.gz">ucd-snmp-4.2.2 or higher</a>!,
	so make sure you get it before running the commands found in
	this tutorial.</b> 
      <p><b>Note:</b>  A new tutorial for net-snmp 5.0 and above <a
      href="{{ site.subdir }}/tutorial-5">is available</a> as well.  The commands is
      the ucd-snmp specific tutorial will not work as expected if you
      are using net-snmp and not ucd-snmp.

    <p> 
      The ucd-snmp toolkit provides a suite of command line
      applications that can be used to query and act on remote SNMP
      agents.  These instructions/lessions do assume that you have
      properly made and installed the package!  If you have not
      installed them, most of them should still work providing that
      you set the environmental variable <i>MIBDIRS</i>to
      <i>SRCDIR/mibs</i>, where <i>SRCDIR</i> is the directory
      containg the ucd-snmp source tree.

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Most of these commands are designed to work if you
      cut and paste them into your own shell.  They all operate on the
      <a href="snmpv3.html">demonstration agent</a> running on the
      ucd-snmp web site host, so you don't have to have an agent
      installed at your site to test these commands.
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Many of these commands assume you are running
      ucd-snmp 4.1 or higher.
