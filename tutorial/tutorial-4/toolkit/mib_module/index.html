    <h1>UCD-SNMP Tutorial -- MIB Module</h1>
    <p>
      Here we discuss how to write a simple mib module, to extend the
      agent using C code.
    <p>
      Here are the files discussed in this example so you can download
      them:
      <center>
      <table border=1>
	<tr bgcolor="#d0d0ff"><th>File</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#d0d0ff"><td><a
	href="UCD-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB.txt">UCD-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB.txt</a></td><td>The MIB we'll be writing
	code for</td>
	<tr bgcolor="#d0d0ff"><td><a
	href="ustScalarSet.h">ustScalarSet.h</a></td><td>The mib module's header file</td>
	<tr bgcolor="#d0d0ff"><td><a
	href="ustScalarSet.c">ustScalarSet.c</a></td><td>The mib module's C source code</td>
      </table>
      </center>
    <p>
      This example builds the C code necessary to implement the <a
      href="UCD-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB.txt">UCD-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB</a> MIB.
      The majority of the code was written using the mib2c program,
      not discussed here.
    <p>
      The API for the mib module code is fully discussed in
      <a>http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~daves/Misc/UCD/guide.html</a> and is
      <b>highly</b> recommended reading material.
    <p>
      The MIB is a simple one (also not discussed extensively here).
      It contains only two variables: a string, and the time since the
      string was last modified.  The string can be set using an
      SNMP-SET, which then updates the archived value and resets the
      timer.
    <p>
      To use it, get the <a
      href="ftp://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/ucd-snmp.tar.gz">ucd-snmp
      source code</a> and extract it.  Then download the 
      <a href="ustScalarSet.h">ustScalarSet.h</a> and
      <a href="ustScalarSet.c">ustScalarSet.c</a> that make up the
      code for the mib module.  Place them in the ucd-snmp source
      directory under the agent/mibgroups sub-directory.  Configure
      the ucd-snmp package to include them when it is compiled by
      adding an argument to the configure script:
    <pre>
% <b>./configure --with-mib-modules=ustScalarSet</b>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that <i>ustScalarSet</i> is the prefix to our .c and .h
      files.
    <p>
      Build your new agent with the tutorial code by running make:
    <pre>
% <b>make</b>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Finally, install the whole lot by running make install:
    <pre>
% <b>make install</b>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Lets use a horrible (security wise) <a
      href="snmpd.conf">snmpd.conf</a> file so we're all consistent.
      Download it and place it in /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.conf.
    <p>
      Lets talk about the important pieces in these files:
...
    <h3>Set Processing</h3>
    <p>
      To process an SNMP-SET, the agent must use a series of calls to
      the mib module code to ensure that processing of all sets in the
      incoming packet can be successful.  This gives you or other mib
      modules the chance to bail out early on in the transaction
      sequence and thus stop all of the transactions in the set from
      happening.  This is important for continuity.  However, it makes 
      set code processing a bit more complex.  Let's examine a simple
      state diagram that the master agent uses at each step of the
      way:
    <p>

    <p>
      In a perfect operation with no failures, we take the vertical
      path on the left.  If <b>any</b> of the mib modules being acted
      upon returns an error of any kind, we will branch to the right
      to one of the failure states where you must clean up and
      possibly undo what you did in previous steps.
