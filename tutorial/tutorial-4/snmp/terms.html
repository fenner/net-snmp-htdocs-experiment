    <h1>SNMP Terminology</h1>
    This document details some of the terminology that might be new to those
    who are not familiar with SNMP.
    <p>
      It's not very comprehensive right now, but we hope to flush it out real
      soon now.
    </p>

      <!-- ========================================================= -->
    <h2>Basic SNMP Terminology</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a name="snmp">SNMP</a> : Simple Network Management Protocol.<p>
        The SNMP specificatins define two things: a protocol and a data
        definition language.
        <br>
        The SNMP protocol defines a few simple operations: GET, GET-NEXT,
        SET and TRAP. Versions 2c and 3 define a few more: GET-BULK and
        INFORM. These are the requests that are sent between clients and
        servers.
        <br>
        The data definition language is the Structure of Management
        Information, or SMI. It is based on ASN.1, and is used to create
        text documents that define Managed Information Bases, or MIBs. A
        MIB defines a set of data objects and the format for those objects.
        Each data object is identified by a unique Object Identifier, or OID.
        </p>
      <li><a name="oid">OID</a> : An Object Identifier<p>
        An OID is a
        series of integers that uniquely identify a data object. OIDs can
        be represented in two ways. The first is using raw numbers, like so:
        <code>.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0</code><p>
        While the raw numbers are easy for a computer to understand, it is
        a little harder for us humans. A MIB can be used to convert the
        number to the names used in the MIB. The above OID translates to:
        <code>.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysName.0</code><br>
        </p>
      <li><a name="pdu">PDU</a> : A Protocol Data Unit<p>
        A PDU is simply
        a data packet. The SNMP specifications define the format for
        each supported PDU type. SNMP PDUs contain various header fields
        (which depend on the protocol version being used and the PDU
        type), and variable bindings (varbinds).
        </p>
      <li><a name="varbind">varbinds</a> : Variable bindings<p>
        A Variable binding, or varbind, is an OID for an object, and the
          data value associated with that object.
        </p>
      <li><a name="get">GET request</a><p>
        A GET request PDU ...
        </p>
      <li><a name="getnext">GETNEXT request</a><p>
        ...
        </p>
      <li><a name="set">SET request</a><p>
          ...
        </p>
      <li><a name="notification">Notifications</a><p>
          A notification is an unsolicted message from a SNMP agent or device
          that is sent to a notification receiver (aka Network Managment
          System (NMS) or Element Management System (EMS)). Notifications
          generally indicate a status change on the device. It could be
          information about the change, or a message to indicate an alarm
          condition.
          SNMP defines two types of notifications: traps and informs.
        </p>
      <li><a name="trap">Traps</a><p>
          A SNMP trap is an unsolicited message sent to a notification
          receiver. Unlike messages sent to a SNMP agent, traps are not
          confirmed by the receiver. If it is critical that a Network
          Management System (NMS) be able to detect when a message is
          lost, then the device must provide a method for detecting
          lost messages, such as a log table or sequence numbers. If
          the device supports informs, critical notifications should be
          sent using informs.
        </p>
      <li><a name="informs">Informs</a><p>
          A SNMP inform is an unsolicited message sent to a notification
          receiver. It was not introduced into the protocol until SNMP
          version 2c, so it is not availabe in devices that only support
          SNMP version 1. Unlike SNMP traps, informs are confirmed
          messages, and thus are more appropriate for critical notifications.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <h2> SNMP Related Terminology</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a name="subagent"></a>
        <p>
          A SNMP subagent is a process which uses a protocol other than
          SNMP to communicate with a master agent. The subagent does not
          directly communicate with SNMP client, instead it relies on the
          master agent to handle the protocol details of SNMP. One of the
          primary advantages of subagents is that they can be added or
          removed dynamically, and new agents can be developed with any
          changes to the master agent. The two most commonly used protocols
          for subagents are <a href="#AgentX">AgentX</a> and
          <a href="#SMUX">SMUX</a>.
      <li><a name="AgentX"></a>
        <p>
          AgentX is an agent extension protocol. An AgentX master agent
          acts as a central communication center for one or more AgentX
          <a href="#subagent">sub-agents</a>. The
          <a href="http://www.ietf.org">IETF</a> document
          defining AgentX is
          <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2741.html">RFC 2741</a>.
        </p>
      <li><a name="SMUX"></a>
        <p>
          SMUX is an agent extension protocol. It started on the
          <a href="http://www.ietf.org">IETF</a> standards track, but was
          superceded by later work (eg AgentX), and the document defining it
          (<a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1227.html">RFC 1227</a>)
          was moved to <i>historic</i> status.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <!-- ========================================================= -->
    <h2>MIB Terminology</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a name="max-access">MAX-ACCESS</a>
        <p>
      <li><a name="augment">Augmentation</a> table
        <p>
    </ul>

    <!-- ========================================================= -->
    <h2>Network/Socket Terminology</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a name="udp">UDP</a>
        <p>
          UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is a network packet protocol, defined
          in <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc768.html">RFC 768</a>. UDP
          is a <i>connectionless</i> protocol, which means that the packet is
          sent, and no confirmation is received from the other side (like sending
          a letter in the mail). This makes it less resource intensive, but also
          less reliable, than TCP connections.
        </p>
      <li><a name="tcp">TCP</a>
        <p>
          TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is a network packet protocol,
          defined in
          <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.html">RFC 793</a>. TCP
          is a <i>connection oriented</i> protocol, which means that the
          sender and receiver communicate to try and ensure the packet is
          delivered (like sending a fax). This makes it more resource intensive,
          but also more reliable than UDP packets.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <!-- ========================================================= -->
    <h2>SNMP Table Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a name="dependencies">Dependencies</a><br>
        When one or more columns in a table depend on another object (in the same
        table, or in another table), a <b>DEPENDENCY</b> exists. For example, if you
            have a table that determine a color with three columns (red, green and
            blue) that define the percentage of each primary color, the total for
            the three columns must equal 100 percent. So, in addition to checking
            that each colums has a valid value between 0 and 100, the total of
            all three columns must equal 100.
        <p>
      <li><a name="rowcreate">row creation</a>
        <p>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- ========================================================= -->
    <h2>Net-SNMP Developer Terminology</h2>
        
    <h3>Table attributes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a name="transient">Transient</a> data<br>
       TRANSIENT data is data that may be overwritten by another funtion
       or process. For example, many OS functions return data in a
       static buffer that will be reused the next time the function is
       called.  Because of this, we will assume that you will copy the
       raw data retrieved from these other sources to a generated
       structure for use within the Net-SNMP agent.  (Don't worry, we'll
       help you)
        <p>
      <li><a name="external">External</a> data<br>
       EXTERNAL data is data that is owned by some other process,
       device, file or mechanism.  The agent must use some interface to
       read or modify the data.  An external process may modify the data
       without the agent's knowledge. For example, the Net-SNMP agent
       implements the interface table (ifTable), which reports on
       network interfaces. The host operating system owns this data, and
       Net-SNMP must use system calls to report or manipulate the data.
       Examples of external data include data stored in kernel space, in
       files, in another non-memory shared process, and data stored in
       devices.
        <p>
      <li><a name="unsorted">Unsorted</a> data<br>
       UNSORTED data is data that is not kept in the same order as the way
       SNMP expects the index(es) for the table to be kept. [It could very
       well be sorted in some other order, but for the purpose of SNMP, the
       order is incorrect.]  If you're not sure if your data is sorted
       in an SNMP compliant way, its likely not.
        <p>
       Because the raw data is unsorted, to satisfy a particular request, the
       entire data set must be examined to find the apropriate index.
        <p>
    </ul>
