<H1> Non-table-based modules </H1>

Having looked at the general structure of a module implementation,
it's now time to look at this in more detail.  We'll start with the
simplest style of module - a collection of independent variables.
This could easily be implemented as a series of completely separate 
modules - the main reason for combining them is to avoid the proliferation
of multiple versions of very similar code.
<P>
  Recall that the variable handling routine needs to cover two distinct
purposes - validation of the request, and provision of the answer.  In
this style of module, these are handled separately.
Once again, <CODE>mib2c</CODE> does much of the donkey work, generating
the whole of the request validation code (so the description of this section
can be skipped if desired), and even providing a skeleton
for returning the data. This latter still requires some input from the
programmer, to actually return the correct results (rather than dummy values).

<H2>Request Validation</H2>

This is done using a standard utility function <CODE>header_generic</CODE>.
The parameters for this are exactly the same as
for the main routine, and are simply passed through directly.
It returns an integer result, as a flag to indicate
whether the validation succeeded or not.
<BR>
  If the validation fails, then the main routine should return immediately,
leaving the parameters untouched, and indicate the failure by returning a
NULL value.  Thus the initial code fragment of a scalar-variable style
implementation will typically look like:

<PRE>
    u_char  *
    var_system(vp, name, length, exact, var_len, write_method)
    {
	if (header_generic(vp, name, length, exact, var_len, write_method)
						== MATCH_FAILED )
	    return NULL;

	<I>[ etc, etc, etc ]</I>
    }
</PRE>

  Although the utility function can be used as a "black box",
it's worth looking more closely at exactly what it does (since
the table-handling modules will need to do something fairly similar).
It has two (or possibly three) separate functions:
<UL>
<LI>checking that the request is valid,
<LI>setting up the OID for the result,
<LI>and (optionally) setting up default values for the other return parameters.
</UL>
<BR>
  In order to actually validate the request, the header routine first needs
to construct the OID under consideration, in order to compare it with
that originally asked for.  The driving code has already combined the
OID prefix (constant throughout the module) with the entry-specific suffix,
before calling the main variable handler.
This is available via the <CODE>name</CODE>
field of the parameter <CODE>vp</CODE>.  
  For a scalar variable, completing the OID is therefore
simply a matter of appending the instance identifier 0 to this.
The full OID is
built up in a local oid array <CODE>newname</CODE> defined for this purpose.
<BR>
This gives the following code fragment:

<PRE>
    int
    header_generic(vp, name, length, exact, var_len, write_method)
    {
	oid newname[MAX_NAME_LEN];

	memcpy((char *)newname, (char *)vp->name,
			(int)vp->namelen * sizeof(oid));
	newname[ vp->namelen ] = 0;

		:
    }
</PRE>

<P>
  Having formed the OID, this can then be compared against the variable
specified in the original request, which is available as the <CODE>name</CODE> parameter.
This comparison is done using the <CODE>snmp_oid_compare</CODE> function, which takes the
two OIDs (together with their respective lengths), and returns -1, 0 or 1
depending on whether the first OID precedes, matches or follows the second.
<P>
In the case of an 'exact' match (i.e. a GET/SET/etc), then the request is only
valid if the two OIDs are identical (<CODE>snmp_oid_compare</CODE> returns 0).
In the case of a
GETNEXT (or GETBULK) request, it's valid if the OID being considered comes
after that of the original request (<CODE>snmp_oid_compare</CODE> returns -1).
<P>
  This gives the code fragment

<PRE>
	result = snmp_oid_compare(name, *length, newname, (int)vp->namelen + 1);
			<I>// +1 because of the extra instance sub-identifier</I>
	if ((exact && (result != 0))		<I>// GET match fails</I>
		|| (!exact && (result >= 0)))	<I>// GETNEXT match fails</I>
	    return(MATCH_FAILED);
</PRE>


  Note that in this case, we're only interested in the single variable
indicated by the <CODE>vp</CODE> parameter.  The fact that this module may well
implement other variables as well is ignored.  The 'lexically next'
requirement of the GETNEXT request is handled by working through the
variable entries in order until one matches.  And yes, this is not the
most efficient implementation possible!
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1> Note that in releases prior to 3.6, the <CODE>snmp_oid_compare</CODE>
function was called simply <CODE>compare</CODE>.  </FONT>

<P>
  Finally, having determined that the request is valid, this routine must
update the <CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>length</CODE> parameters to return
the OID being processed.
It also sets default values for the other two return parameters.

<PRE>
	memcpy( (char *)name,(char *)newname,
		((int)vp->namelen + 1) * sizeof(oid));
	*length = vp->namelen + 1;
	*write_method = 0;		<I>// Non-writeable</I>
	*var_len = sizeof(long);	<I>// default to integer results</I>
	return(MATCH_SUCCEEDED);
</PRE>


These three code fragments combine to form the full <CODE>header_generic</CODE>
code which can be seen in the file <CODE>util_funcs.c</CODE>
<P>
  <B>Note</B>: This validation used to be done using a separate function for
each module (conventionally called <CODE>header_</CODE><I>{name}</I>),
and many modules may still be coded in this style.  The code for these are
to all intents and purposes identical to the <CODE>header_generic</CODE>
routine described above.


<H2>Data Retrieval</H2>

  The other main job of the request handling routine is to retrieve any
necessary data, and return the appropriate answer to the original request.
This must be done even if <CODE>mib2c</CODE> is being used to generate
the framework of the implementation. 
As has been indicated earlier, the different cases are handled using
a <CODE>switch</CODE> statement, with the <I>Magic Number</I> field of the <CODE>vp</CODE> parameter
being used to distinguish between them.
<BR>
  The data necessary for answering the request can be retrieved for each
variable individually in the relevant case statement
(as is the case with the system group), or using a
common block of data before processing the switch (as is done for the ICMP
group, among others).
<P>
  With many of the modules implemented so far, this data is read
from a kernel structure. This can be done using the <CODE>auto_nlist</CODE> routine
already mentioned, providing a variable in which to store the results
and an indication of its size (see the <CODE>!HAVE_SYS_TCPIPSTATS_H</CODE> case of
the ICMP group for an example).
Alternatively, there may be <CODE>ioctl</CODE> calls on suitable
devices, specific system calls, or special files that can be read to
provide the necessary information.
<P>
  If the available data provides the requested value immediately, then
the individual branch becomes a simple assignment to the appropriate
static return variable - either one of the global static variables
(e.g <CODE>long_return</CODE>) or the local equivalents (such as generated by<CODE>mib2c</CODE>). 
Otherwise, the requested value may need to be calculated by combining two
or more items of data (e.g. <CODE>IPINHDRERRORS</CODE> in <CODE>mibII/ip.c</CODE>) or by applying
a mapping or other calculation involving available information (e.g. <CODE>IPFORWARDING</CODE>
from the same group).
<P>
  In each of these cases, the routine should return a pointer to the
result value, casting this to the pseudo-generic <CODE>(u_char *)</CODE>
<P>

So much for the scalar case.
