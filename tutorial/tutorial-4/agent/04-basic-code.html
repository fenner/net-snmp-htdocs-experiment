<H1> Core structure of the implementation code </H1>

The core work of implementing the module is done in the C code file.
As indicated earlier, much of the detail of this will be dependent
on the particular module being implemented, and this can only be
described by the individual programmer concerned.
<BR>
  However, there is a fairly clearly defined framework that the
implementation will need to follow, though this varies slightly
depending on the style of the module being implemented
(in particular whether it forms a table
or a series of individual values).  The differences will be covered
in the following pages, but we first need to consider the overall shape
of the framework, and the elements that are common to all styles.
These are essentially the compulsory routines, the common
header definitions, and assorted initialisation code.
<BR>
As with the header file, most of this will be generated automatically
by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>.


<H3> Standard includes </H3>

  Certain header files are either compulsory, or required so frequently
that they should be included as a matter of course.  These are as follows:

<PRE>
  #include &lt;config.h&gt;			<I>// local SNMP configuration details</I>
  #include "mib_module_config.h"	<I>// list of which modules are supported </I>
  #if HAVE_STDLIB_H
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #endif
  #if HAVE_STRING_H
  #include &lt;string.h&gt;
  #else
  #include &lt;strings.h&gt;
  #endif

  #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
</PRE>

All of these will usually be the first files to be included.

<PRE>
  #include "mibincl.h"			<I>// Standard set of SNMP includes</I>
  #include "util_funcs.h"		<I>// utility function declarations</I>
  #include "read_config.h"		<I>// if the module uses run-time</I>
					<I>//	configuration controls</I>
  #include "auto_nlist.h"		<I>// structures for a BSD-based</I>
					<I>//	kernel using nlist</I>
  #include "system.h"

  #include "name.h"			<I>// the module-specific header</I>
</PRE>


These conventionally come at the end of the list of includes.
In between will come all the standard system-provided header files
required for the library functions used in the file.


<H3>Module definition</H3>

  Much of the code defining the contents of the MIB has traditionally
been held in the header file.  However, much of this has slowly migrated
to the code file, and this is now the recommended location for it
(as typified by the output of <CODE>mib2c</CODE).
The main element of this is a variable structure
specifying the details of the objects implemented.
This takes the form of an
unconstrained array of type <CODE>struct variable</CODE><I>N</I>
(where <I>N</I> is the length of the longest suffix in the table). Thus
<PRE>
		struct variable<I>2</I> example_variables[] = {
			&lt; individual entries go here &gt;
		};
</PRE>
		
 Each entry corresponds to one object in the MIB tree (or one column in the
case of table entries), and these should be listed in increasing OID order.
A single entry consists of six fields:
<UL>
<LI> a <I>magic number</I> (the #defined integer constant described earlier)
<LI> a type indicator (from the values listed in &lt;snmplib/snmp_impl.h&gt;)
<LI> an access indicator (essentially <CODE>RWRITE</CODE> or <CODE>RONLY</CODE>)
<LI> the name of the routine used to handle this entry
<LI> the length of the OID suffix used, and
<LI> an array of integers specifying this suffix
		(more on this in a moment)
</UL>		
Thus a typical variable entry would look like:
<PRE>
	{ EXAMPLESTRING, ASN_OCTET_STR, RONLY, var_example, 1, {1}}
</PRE>	
If the magic numbers have not been defined in the header file, then they
should be defined here, usually comming immediately before the corresponding
variable entry.  This is the technique used by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>.
<BR>
  Note that in practise, only certain sizes of the structure
variable<I>N</I>  are defined (listed in
<CODE>&lt;agent/var_struct.h&gt;</CODE>),
being sufficient to meet the common requirements.  If your particular module
needs a non-supported value, the easiest thing is simply to use the next
largest value that is supported.
<P>
The module also needs to declare the location within the MIB tree where
it should be registered.  This is done using a declaration of the form
<PRE>
	oid example_variables_oid[] = { 1,3,6,1,4,1,2021,254 }
</PRE>
where the contents of the array give the object identifier of the
root of the module.


<H3>Module initialisation</H3>

  Many modules require some form of initialisation before they can
start providing the necessary information.  This is done by providing
a routine called <CODE>init_</CODE><I>{name}</I>
(where <I>{name}</I> is the name of the module).
<BR>
This routine is theoretically optional, but in practise is required to
<I>register</I> this module with the main agent at the very least.
This specifies the list of variables being implemented (from the variableN
structure) and declare where these fit into the overall MIB tree.

<P>
This is done by using the <CODE>REGISTER_MIB</CODE> macro,
as follows:
<PRE>
	REGISTER_MIB( "example",  example_variables, variable2,
			example_variables_oid );
</PRE>

where <CODE>"example"</CODE> is used for identification purposed
(and is usually the name being used for the module),
<CODE>example_variables</CODE>
is the structure defining the variables being implemented,
<CODE>variable2</CODE> is the type used for this structure,
and <CODE>example_variables_oid</CODE> is the location of the root.
<P>
In fact, this macro is simply a wrapper round the routine
<CODE>register_mib()</CODE>, but the details of this can safely be
ignored, unless more control over the registration is required.


<P>
  One common requirement, particularly on older operating systems or
for the more obscure areas of the system, is to be able to read data
directly from kernel memory.  The preparation for this is typically done
here by one or more statements of the form
<PRE>
	#ifdef <I>{NAME}</I>_SYMBOL
	auto_nlist( <I>{NAME}</I>_SYMBOL, 0, 0);
	#endif
</PRE>

where <I>{NAME}</I>_SYMBOL is defined as part of the system-specific configuration,
to be the name of the appropriate kernel variable or data structure.
(The two 0 values are because the kernel information is simply being
primed at this point - this call will be reused later when the actual
values are required).
Note that this is probably the first thing described so far which isn't
provided by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>!

<P>
  Other possibilities for initialisation may include registering config file
directive handlers (which are documented in the <CODE>read_config(5)</CODE>
man page), and registering the MIB module (either in whole or in part)
in the sysOR table.
The first of these is covered in the example module, and the
second in many of the other modules within the main UCD distribution.


<H3>Variable handling</H3>

The other obligatory routine is that which actually handles a request
for a particular variable instance.  This is the routine that appeared
in the variable<I>N</I> structure, so while the name is not fixed, it
should be the same as was used there.
<BR>
  This routine has six parameters, which will be described in turn.
<P>
Four of these parameters are used for passing in information about the
request, these being:
<PRE>
	struct variable *vp;
		<I>// The entry in the </I><CODE>variable</CODE><I>N array from the
		//   header file, for the object under consideration.
		// Note that the </I><CODE>name</CODE><I> field of this structure has been
		//   completed into a fully qualified OID, by prepending
		//   the prefix common to the whole array.</I>
	oid *name;	<I>// The OID from the request</I>
	int *length;	<I>// The length of this OID</I>
	int exact;	<I>// A flag to indicate whether this is an exact
			// request (GET/SET) or an 'inexact' one (GETNEXT)</I>
</PRE>

Four of the parameters are used to return information about the answer.
The function also returns a pointer to the actual data for the variable
requested (or NULL if this data is not available for any reason).
The other result parameters are:

<PRE>
	oid *name;	<I>// The OID being returned</I>
	int *length;	<I>// The length of this OID</I>
	int *var_len;	<I>// The length of the answer being returned</I>
	WriteMethod **write_method;
			<I>// A pointer to the SET function for this variable</I>
</PRE>

Note that two of the parameters (<CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>length</CODE>)
serve a dual purpose, being used for both input and output.

<P>
  The first thing that this routine needs to do is to validate the request,
to ensure that it does indeed lie in the range implemented by this
particular module.  This is done in slightly different ways, depending on
the style of the module, so this will be discussed in more detail later.
<BR>
At the same time, it is common to retrieve some of the information needed
for answering the query.
<P>
  Then the routine uses the <I>Magic Number</I> field from the <CODE>vp</CODE>
parameter to determine which of the possible variables being implemented
is being requested.
This is done using a <CODE>switch</CODE> statement, which should have as many cases as
there are entries in the variable<I>N</I> array (or more precisely, as many as specify
this routine as their handler), plus an additional <CODE>default</CODE> case to
handle an erroneous call.
<BR>
  Each branch of the switch statement needs to ensure that the return
parameters are filled in correctly, set up a (static) return variable
with the correct data, and then return a pointer to this value.
These can be done separately for each branch, or once at the start,
being overridden in particular branches if necessary.

<P>
In fact, the default validation routines make the assumption that
the variable is both read-only, and of integer type (which includes the
<CODE>COUNTER</CODE> and <CODE>GAUGE</CODE> types among others), and set the
return paramaters <CODE>write_method</CODE> and <CODE>var_len</CODE>
appropriately.
These settings can then be corrected for those cases when either or
both of these assumptions are wrong.
Examples of this can be seen in the example module.
<CODE>EXAMPLEINTEGER</CODE> is writeable, so this branch sets the
<CODE>write_method</CODE> parameter,
and <CODE>EXAMPLEOBJECTID</CODE> is not an integer, so this branch sets the
<CODE>var_len</CODE> parameter.
In the case of <CODE>EXAMPLESTRING</CODE>, both assumptions are wrong, so this
branch needs to set both these parameters explicitly.
<P>
  Note that because the routine returns a pointer to a <B>static</B> result,
a suitable variable must be declared somewhere for this.  Two global variables
are provided for this purpose - <CODE>long_return</CODE> (for integer results) and
<CODE>return_buf</CODE> (for other types).  This latter is a generic array (of type
<CODE>u_char</CODE>) that can contain up to 256 bytes of data.
Alternatively, static variables can be declared, either within the code file,
or local to this particular variable routine.  This last is the approach
adopted by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>, which defines four such local variables,
(<CODE>long_ret, string, objid</CODE> and <CODE>c64</CODE>).

<H3>Mib2c requirements</H3>
Most of the code described here is generated by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>.
The main exceptions (which therefore need to be provided by the programmer)
are
<UL>
<LI>  Any initialisation, other than the basic registration<BR>
(including kernel data initialisation, config file handling,
or sysOR registration).
<LI>  Retrieving the necessary data, and setting the appropriate return
value correctly.
<LI>  The <CODE>var_len</CODE> (and possibly  <CODE>write_method</CODE>)
return parameters for variable types that are not recognised by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>
<LI>  The contents of any write routines (see later).
</UL> 
Everything else should be useable as generated.
<P>
<HR>
This concludes the preliminary walk-through of the general structure of the
C implementation.  To fill in the details, we will need to consider the various
styles of module separately.  The <A HREF=05-nontable.html>next part</A>
will look at scalar (i.e. non-table based) modules.
