<H1>Extending the UCD-SNMP agent</H1>

This series of documents describe the procedure
for writing code to extend the functionality of the
UCD-SNMP network management agent.
We would be very interested in comment and feedback about
how useful you find this description,
and ways in which it could be improved.
<P>
The information is designed to be read in order - the structure being:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="01-intro.html">Overview & Introduction</A>
<LI><A HREF="02-mib.html">MIB files, and how they relate to the agent implementation</A>
<LI><A HREF="03-header.html">Header files</A>
<LI><A HREF="04-basic-code.html">The basic structure of module implementation code</A>
<LI><A HREF="05-nontable.html">The details of non-table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="06-table1.html">The details of simple table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="07-table2.html">The details of more general table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="08-writing.html">How to implement SET-able variables</A>
</OL>
While the document is intended to be generally self-contained,
it does occasionally refer to code files shipped with the main UCD
distribution (in particular the example module), and it may prove
useful to have these files available for reference.
