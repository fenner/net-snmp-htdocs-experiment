<H1>Extending the UCD-SNMP agent</H1>

This is a first draft at documenting the procedure
for writing code to extend the functionality of the
UCD-SNMP network management agent.
<P>
It is copyright the author, and must not be distributed
without explicit permission.
This is purely because
I do not yet regard this as sufficiently well
checked or polished to be suitable for distribution.
However, there is a clear need for this sort of information,
hence it is being made available over the Web as an interim
measure.
<P>
If you do make use of these documents, please can you contact
me regarding how useful and accurate (or otherwise) you
found the information.  The more feedback I receive, the faster
this guide will reach a presentable state - at which point it
can be distributed with the main UCD-SNMP package.
<P>
The information is designed to be read in order - the structure being:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="01-intro.html">Overview & Introduction</A>
<LI><A HREF="02-mib.html">MIB files, and how they relate to the agent implementation</A>
<LI><A HREF="03-header.html">Header files</A>
<LI><A HREF="04-basic-code.html">The basic structure of module implementation code</A>
<LI><A HREF="05-nontable.html">The details of non-table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="06-table1.html">The details of simple table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="07-table2.html">The details of more general table based implementations</A>
<LI><A HREF="08-writing.html">How to implement SET-able variables</A>
</OL>
<HR>
There's also a 
<A HREF=CheckList.html>step-by-step checklist</A>
that you can use if adding your MIB module doesn't
seem to be working.
