<TITLE>Extending the UCD agent - the header file</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1> The C code header file </H1>

If the MIB file is the definition of the module for external network management
applications (where applications includes network management personnel!), then
the header file has traditionally served effectively the same purpose for
the agent itself.
<BR>
  Recent changes to the recommended code structure has resulted in the
header file becoming increasingly simpler.  It now simply contains definitions
of the publically visible routines, and can be generated completely by
<CODE>mib2c</CODE>.

<H3>Function prototypes</H3>

For those interested in the details of this file (for example, if
coding a module by hand), then the details of these definitions are
as follows.
Every header file will have the following two function prototype definitions
<PRE>
	extern void          init_example (void);
	extern FindVarMethod var_example;
</PRE>
If the module includes any tables, or other collections of variables
that are implemented in separate routines, then this second definition
will be repeated for each of these.
<BR>
In addition, if any of the variables can be SET (and it is intended
to implement them as such), there will be a function prototype definitions
for each of these, of the form:
<PRE>
	extern writeMethod write_<I>varName</I>;
</PRE>
These prototypes are in fact typedef'ed in
<CODE>&lt; agent/snmp_vars.h &gt;</CODE>.

<H3>Module dependancies</H3>

This header file is also used to inform the compilation system of
any dependancies between this module and any others.
There is one <I>utility module</I> which is required by almost
every module, and this is included using the directive

<PRE>
	config_require( util_funcs )
</PRE>

(which is produced automatically by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>).
This same syntax can be used to trigger the inclusion of other
related modules.  An example of this can be seen in
<CODE>mibII/route_write.h</CODE> which relies on the <CODE>mibII/ip</CODE>
module, thus:
<PRE>
	config_require( mibII/ip )
</PRE>
<P>
One use of this directive is to define a module group, by supplying a header
file consisting exclusively of such config_require directives.  It can then
be included or excluded from the agent very simply.
Examples of this can be seen in <CODE>mibgroup/mibII.h</CODE>
or <CODE>mibgroup/host.h</CODE>, which list the consituent sub-modules
of the MIB-II and Host Resources MIBs respectively.

<H3>MIB file information</H3>

Most of the information in this file is (understandably) aimed at the network
management agent itself.  However, there is one common header file directive
that is actually intended to affect the utility commands that are included
within the full distribution:
<PRE>
	config_add_mib( HOST-RESOURCES-MIB )
</PRE>
  This is used to add the MIB file being implemented to the default list of
MIBs loaded by such commands.  This means that querying the agent will return
informative names and values, rather than the raw numeric forms that SNMP
actually works with.  Of course, it is always possible for the utilities
to specify that this MIB should be loaded anyway.  But specifying this file
within the module header file is a useful hint that a particular MIB should
be loaded, without needing to ask for it explicitly.
<BR>
  Note that this will only affect the binaries compiled as part of the same
configuration run.  It will have no effect on pre-installed binaries, or
those compiled following a different configuration specification.

<H3>Magic Numbers</H3>

The other common element within the header file defines a set of "magic
numbers" - one for each object within the implementation module. In fact,
this can equally well appear within the main code file, as part of the
variable structure (which will be described in the next part).
<BR>
This is the technique used by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>, but most handcrafted modules
have tended to define these as part of the header file, probably for clarity.
<P>
The only necessity is that the names and values are distinct (or more
precisely, the values are distinct within a single variable handling routine).
In practise, they tend to be defined using integers incrementing from 1,
or as the same as the final sub-identifier of the corresponding MIB object
(or indeed both, as these are frequently themselves successive integers).
<BR>
  This is not mandatory, and a counter-example can be seen in the
example module, where two of the object form a sub-tree, and the corresponding
magic numbers are based on the final <B>two</B> sub-identifiers (to ensure that
the values are unique).  But this construction is definitely unusual, and
the majority of modules simply use successive integers.

<H3>Header file protection</H3>

Normally, the only other contents of the header file will be the
<CODE>#ifndef/#define/#endif</CODE> statements surrounding the whole file.
This is used to ensure that the header file is only included once
by any source code file (or more accurately, that there is no effect
if it is inadvertantly included a second time).
<BR>
Again, as with the rest of the header file, this is generated automatically
by <CODE>mib2c</CODE>.

<P>
Having finished all the preparatory work (or let <CODE>mib2c</CODE> deal
with it), the <A HREF=04-basic-code.html>
next part</A> starts to look at the code file that actually implements
the module.
