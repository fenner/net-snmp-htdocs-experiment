<H1> How to implement a SETable object </H1>

Finally, the only remaining area to cover is that of setting data -
the handling of <CODE>SNMPSET</CODE>.  Particular care should be
taken here for two reasons.
<P>
  Firstly, any errors in the earlier sections can have limited effect.
The worst that is likely to happen is that the agent will either return
invalid information, or possibly crash.  Either way, this is unlikely to
affect the operation of the workstation as a whole.  If there are problems
in the writing routine, the results could be catastrophic (particularly
if writing data directly into kernel memory).
<P>
  Secondly, this is the least well understood area of the agent, at least
by the author.  There are relatively few variables that are defined as
<CODE>READ-WRITE</CODE> in the relevant MIBs, and even fewer that have
actually been implemented as such.
I'm therefore describing this from a combination of my understanding of
how SETs ought to work, personal experience of very simple SET handling
and what's actually been done by others (which do not necessarily coincide).
<P>
There are also subtle differences between the setting of simple
scalar variables (or individual entries within a table), and
the creation of a new row within a table.  This will therefore
be considered separately.
<P>
  With these caveats, and a healthy dose of caution, let us proceed.
Note that the UCD-SNMP development team can accept no responsibility
for any damage or loss resulting from either following or ignoring the
information presented here.  You coded it - you fix it!
<P>
  <B>N.B:</B>  The API for the write routine changed slightly between
the 3.x and 4.x releases of the UCD agent. In particular, the value to
be set was still ASN1-encoded in the 3.x agent, but was directly available
as a normal value in the 4.x line.
This was a side effect of other internal changes, but was also felt to
provide a significantly easier environment with which to work.
We apologise for the inconvenience, but refunds are not available :-)


<H3>Write routine</H3>

The heart of SET handling is the <CODE>write_method</CODE> parameter from
the variable handling routine.  This is a pointer to the relevant
routine for setting the variable in question.
<CODE>Mib2c</CODE> will generate one such routine for each setable variable.
This routine should be declared using the template
<PRE>
	int
	write_<I>variable</I>(
	   int      action,
	   u_char   *var_val,
	   u_char   var_val_type,
	   int      var_val_len,
	   u_char   *statP,
	   oid      *name,
	   int      name_len );
</PRE>
<P>
Most of these parameters are fairly self explanatory:
<BR>
The last two hold the OID to be set, just as was passed to the
main variable routine.
<P>
  The second, third and fourth parameters provide information about
the new desired value, both the type, value and length.  This is very
similar to the way that results are returned from the main variable routine.
<P>
  The return value of the routine is simply an indication of whether
the current stage of the SET was successful or not.  We'll come back to
this in a minute.  Note that it is the responsibility of this routine to
check that the OID and value provided are appropriate for the variable
being implemented.  This includes (but is not limited to) checking:
<UL>
<LI>the OID is recognised as one this routine can handle
<BR>
		(this should be true if the routine only handles
		 the one variable, and there are no errors in the
		 main variable routine or driving code,
		 but it does no harm to check).

<LI>the value requested is the correct type expected for this OID

<LI>the value requested is appropriate for this OID
<BR>
		(within particular ranges, suitable length, etc, etc)
</UL>

There are two parameters remaining to be considered.
<P>
The fifth parameter, <CODE>statP</CODE>, is the value that would
be returned from a <CODE>GET</CODE> request on this particular variable.
It could be used to check that the requested new value is
consistent with the current state, but its main use is to denote that
a new table row is being created.
In most cases (particularly when dealing with scalar values or single
elements of tables), you can normally simply ignore this parameter.

<H3>Actions</H3>

The final parameter to consider is the first one - <CODE>action</CODE>.
To understand this, it's necessary to know a bit about how SETs
are implemented.
<BR>
  The design of SNMP calls for all variables in a SET request to be
done "as if simultaneously" - i.e. they should all succeed or all fail.
However, in practise, the variables are handled in succession.  Thus,
if one fails, it must be possible to "undo" any changes made to
the other variables in the request.
<BR>
  This is a well understood requirement in the database world, and
is usually implemented using a "multi-stage commit".  This is certainly
the mechanism expected within the SNMP community (and has been made
explicit in the work of the AgentX extensibility group).  In other
words, the routine to handle setting a variable will be called more
than once, and the routine must be able to perform the appropriate
actions depending on how far through the process we currently are.
This is determined by the value of the <CODE>action</CODE> parameter.
<P>
  This is implemented using three basic phases:
<P>
<CODE>RESERVE</CODE> is used to check the syntax of all the variables provided,
that the values being set are sensible and consistent,
and to allocate any resources required for performing the SET.
After this stage, the expectation is that the SET ought to succeed,
though this is not guaranteed.
<BR>
 (In fact, with the UCD agent, this is done in two passes - <CODE>RESERVE1</CODE>,
and <CODE>RESERVE2</CODE>, to allow for dependencies between variables).
<P>
  If any of these calls fail (in either pass)
the write routines are called again with the <CODE>FREE</CODE> action,
to release any resources that have been allocated.  The agent will then return
a failure response to the requesting application.
<P>
Assuming that the <CODE>RESERVE</CODE> phase was successful,
the next stage is indicated by the action value <CODE>ACTION</CODE>.
This is used to actually implement the set
operation.  However, this must either be done into temporary (persistent)
storage, or the previous value stored in a similar way, in case any of the
subsequent <CODE>ACTION</CODE> calls fail.
This can be seen in the example module, where both write routines have static
'old' variables, to hold the previous value of the relevant object.
<P>
  If the <CODE>ACTION</CODE> phase does fail (for example due to an apparently valid, but unacceptable
value, or an unforeseen problem), then the list of write routines are
called again, with the <CODE>UNDO</CODE> action.  This requires the routine to reset
the value that was changed to its previous value (assuming it was actually
changed), and then to release any resources that had been allocated.
As with the <CODE>FREE</CODE> phase, the agent will then return an indication of the error
to the requesting application.
<P>
Only once the <CODE>ACTION</CODE> phase has completed successfully, can the final
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> phase be run.
This is used to complete any writes that were done
into temporary storage, and then release any allocated resources.
Note that all the code in this phase should be "safe" code that cannot possibly
fail (cue hysterical laughter).
The whole intent of the <CODE>ACTION/COMMIT</CODE> division
is that all of the fallible code should be done in the <CODE>ACTION</CODE> phase,
so that it can be backed out if necessary. 

<H3>Table row creation</H3>
What about creating new rows in a table, I hear you ask.  Good Question.
This case can often be detected by the fact that a <CODE>GET</CODE> request
would have failed, and hence the fifth parameter, <CODE>statP</CODE>, will
be null.  This contrasts with changing the values of an element of an existing
row, when the <CODE>statP</CODE> parameter would hold the previous value.
<P>
The details of precisely how to create a new row will clearly depend on the
underlying format of the table.  However, one implementation strategy would
be as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The first column object to be <CODE>SET</CODE> would return a null
value from the var_<I>name</I> routine.  This null <CODE>statP</CODE>
parameter would be the signal to create a new temporary instance of the
underlying data structure, filled with dummy values.
<LI>Subsequent column objects would return pointers to the appropriate
field of this new data structure from the var_<I>name</I> routine,
which would then be filled in by the write routine.
<LI>Once all the necessary fields had been <CODE>SET</CODE>, the
completed temporary instance could be moved into the "standard"
structure (or copied, or otherwise used to set things up appropriately).
</UL>
However, this is purely a theoretical strategy, and has not been tried
by the author.  No guarantees are given as to whether this would actually
work.  There are also questions regarding how to handle incomplete
or overlapping <CODE>SET</CODE> requests.
Anyone who has experience of doing this, please get in touch!


<HR>
And that's it. Congratulations for getting this far.
If you understand everything that's been said,
then you now know as much as the rest of us about the inner workings
of the UCD-SNMP agent.  (Well, very nearly).
<BR>
All that remains is to try putting this into practise.  Good luck!
<P>
And if you've found this helpful, gifts of money, chocolate, alcohol,
and above all feedback, would be most appreciated :-)
