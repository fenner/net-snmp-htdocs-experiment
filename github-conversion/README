General:

- Any .html file that includes -top and -bottom, should instead change to have
  the Jekyll "front matter", with a simple conversion:

<!--#set var="section" value="about" -->
<!--#include virtual="/page-top.html" -->

-->

---
section: about
---


- The default layout is a combination of page-top and page-bottom with the
  content holder in the middle.  It needs some updates:
  - The "<!--#if expr" sections need to change to Liquid expressions
  - We need to find a replacement for the modification date

- A bunch of files in dev/ didn't get converted even though they have
  include top - what happened?

- We need to decide how to handle a bunch of includes of text files
  e.g., about/license.html

- Improvements
  - The current version can move from the template to the config.yaml if we care to

- One-offs
  - support.html uses page-top2.html so wasn't auto-converted
    but there is no page-top2.html
