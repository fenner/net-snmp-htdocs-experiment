General:

- Any .html file that includes -top and -bottom, should instead change to have
  the Jekyll "front matter", with a simple conversion:

<!--#set var="section" value="about" -->
<!--#include virtual="/page-top.html" -->

-->

---
section: about
---


- The default layout is a combination of page-top and page-bottom with the
  content holder in the middle.  It needs some updates:
  - The "<!--#if expr" sections need to change to Liquid expressions
  - We need to find a replacement for the modification date

- Improvements
  - The current version can move from the template to the config.yaml if we care to
  - Each page front matter could get a title
