At the IETF in London, UK the largest collection of net-snmp
developers ever assembled went to a pub to sit, relax, drink a beer
and get to know one another.  We met at the IETF hotel and walked to a
pub called the "Monkey Puzzle".  The pub was chosen solely based on
it's name, as it described the SNMP protocol perfectly.
<p>
Wes and Dave, the two people involved in the project for the longest
period of time, met for the first time face to face after they had
been communicating over email for some 5 years (Dave is still fixing
Wes' bugs to date).  Not only did they get to meet each other, but
they got to meet the two newest core developers as well: John and
Bert.
<p>
The discussions revolved around many topics.  Some discussions even involved
net-snmp.  A general meeting was held after everyone had finished a beer
where it was decided we should go attack other packages, and start
submitting patches to other projects that instrumented their code with
net-snmp mib modules.
