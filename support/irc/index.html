<p>The <b>#net-snmp</b> IRC channel on the <b>irc.freenode.net</b> IRC servers is a place to gather, mingle, and chat. At least 3 of the core developers are known to hang out there regularily.</p>

<p>All IRC traffic in <b>#net-snmp</b> is logged.  Below are all the
IRC logs from the last 31 days.  The rest are still available
(currently) but simply aren't linked within this page for brevity
reasons only.</p>
