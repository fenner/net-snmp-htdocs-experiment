<h2>TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS</h2>

These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document
above.  They are SNMP's way of defining a datatype that is used
repeatedly by other MIB objects.  Any implementation implementing
objects that use one of these definitions must follow its DESCRIPTION
clause as well as the DESCRIPTION clause of the object itself.

A
row which is volatile(2) is lost upon reboot.  A row which
is either nonVolatile(3), permanent(4) or readOnly(5), is
backed up by stable storage.  A row which is permanent(4)
can be changed but not deleted.  A row which is readOnly(5)
cannot be changed nor deleted.

If the value of an object with this syntax is either
permanent(4) or readOnly(5), it cannot be written.
Conversely, if the value is either other(1), volatile(2) or
nonVolatile(3), it cannot be modified to be permanent(4) or
readOnly(5).  (All illegal modifications result in a
'wrongValue' error.)

Every usage of this textual convention is required to
specify the columnar objects which a permanent(4) row must
at a minimum allow to be writable.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpSecurityModel">SnmpSecurityModel</td><td>INTEGER</td><td><pre>An identifier that uniquely identifies a
Security Model of the Security Subsystem within
this SNMP Management Architecture.

The values for securityModel are allocated as
follows:

- The zero value does not identify any particular
  security model.

- Values between 1 and 255, inclusive, are reserved
  for standards-track Security Models and are
  managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
  (IANA).
- Values greater than 255 are allocated to
  enterprise-specific Security Models.  An
  enterprise-specific securityModel value is defined
  to be:

  enterpriseID * 256 + security model within
  enterprise

  For example, the fourth Security Model defined by
  the enterprise whose enterpriseID is 1 would be
  259.

This scheme for allocation of securityModel
values allows for a maximum of 255 standards-
based Security Models, and for a maximum of
256 Security Models per enterprise.

It is believed that the assignment of new
securityModel values will be rare in practice
because the larger the number of simultaneously
utilized Security Models, the larger the
chance that interoperability will suffer.
Consequently, it is believed that such a range
will be sufficient.  In the unlikely event that
the standards committee finds this number to be
insufficient over time, an enterprise number
can be allocated to obtain an additional 256
possible values.

Note that the most significant bit must be zero;
hence, there are 23 bits allocated for various
organizations to design and define non-standard

securityModels.  This limits the ability to
define new proprietary implementations of Security
Models to the first 8,388,608 enterprises.

It is worthwhile to note that, in its encoded
form, the securityModel value will normally
require only a single byte since, in practice,
the leftmost bits will be zero for most messages
and sign extension is suppressed by the encoding
rules.

As of this writing, there are several values
of securityModel defined for use with SNMP or
reserved for use with supporting MIB objects.
They are as follows:

    0  reserved for 'any'
    1  reserved for SNMPv1
    2  reserved for SNMPv2c
    3  User-Based Security Model (USM)
                </pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="RowStatus">RowStatus</td><td>INTEGER<table class="enums"><tr><th>Value</th><th>Label/Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>notInService</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>notReady</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>createAndGo</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>createAndWait</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>destroy</td></tr></table></td><td><pre>The RowStatus textual convention is used to manage the
creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus
     value, the column in question may be changed if the
     RowStatus was not equal to `active' as the PDU was
     received, or if the varbind sets the status</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpAdminString">SnmpAdminString</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing administrative
information, preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this
information is represented using the ISO/IEC
IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
string using the UTF-8 transformation format
described in [RFC2279].

Since additional code points are added by
amendments to the 10646 standard from time
to time, implementations must be prepared to
encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
code point or are outside this range are
prohibited.

The use of control codes should be avoided.

When it is necessary to represent a newline,
the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

The use of leading or trailing white space should
be avoided.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative
means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
may be provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
single character / code point; thus the length
of this object in octets may be different from
the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
size constraints refer to the number of encoded
octets, not the number of characters represented
by an encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
[RFC3416].

Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
measured in octets, not characters.
