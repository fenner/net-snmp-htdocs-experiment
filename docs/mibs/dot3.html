  COUNTER

  </td><td>ReadOnly</td>

<pre>
A count of frames received on a particular
interface that are not an integral number of
octets in length and do not pass the FCS check.

The count represented by an instance of this
object is incremented when the alignmentError
status is returned by the MAC service to the
LLC (or other MAC user). Received frames for
which multiple error conditions pertain are,
according to the conventions of IEEE 802.3
Layer Management, counted exclusively according

to the error status presented to the LLC.

This counter does not increment for group
encoding schemes greater than 4 bits per group.

For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this
counter can roll over in less than 5 minutes if
it is incrementing at its maximum rate.  Since
that amount of time could be less than a
management station's poll cycle time, in order
to avoid a loss of information, a management
station is advised to poll the
dot3HCStatsAlignmentErrors object for 10 Gb/s
or faster interfaces.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
occur at re-initialization of the management
system, and at other times as indicated by the
value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

<pre>
******** THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********
This object contains an OBJECT IDENTIFIER
                    which identifies the chipset used to
                    realize the interface. Ethernet-like
                    interfaces are typically built out of
                    several different chips. The MIB implementor
                    is presented with a decision of which chip
                    to identify via this object. The implementor
                    should identify the chip which is usually
                    called the Medium Access Control chip.
                    If no such chip is easily identifiable,
                    the implementor should identify the chip
                    which actually gathers the transmit
                    and receive statistics and error
                    indications. This would allow a
                    manager station to correlate the
                    statistics and the chip generating
                    them, giving it the ability to take
                    into account any known anomalies
                    in the chip.
This object has been deprecated.  Implementation
                    feedback indicates that it is of limited use for
                    debugging network problems in the field, and
                    the administrative overhead involved in
                    maintaining a registry of chipset OIDs is not
                    justified.

For an interface operating at 100 Mb/s, the

For an interface operating at 10 Gb/s, the

there was at least one occurrence of an event
that causes the PHY to indicate 'Receive Error'

The count represented by an instance of this

The current mode of operation of the MAC
entity.  'unknown' indicates that the current
duplex mode could not be determined.

Management control of the duplex mode is
accomplished through the MAU MIB.  When
an interface does not support autonegotiation,
or when autonegotiation is not enabled, the
duplex mode is controlled using
ifMauDefaultType.  When autonegotiation is
supported and enabled, duplex mode is controlled
using ifMauAutoNegAdvertisedBits.  In either
case, the currently operating duplex mode is
reflected both in this object and in ifMauType.

Note that this object provides redundant
information with ifMauType.  Normally, redundant
objects are discouraged.  However, in this
instance, it allows a management application to
determine the duplex status of an interface
without having to know every possible value of
ifMauType.  This was felt to be sufficiently
valuable to justify the redundancy.

This object represents the
administratively-configured PAUSE mode for this
interface.  If auto-negotiation is not enabled
or is not implemented for the active MAU
attached to this interface, the value of this
object determines the operational PAUSE mode
of the interface whenever it is operating in
full-duplex mode.  In this case, a set to this
object will force the interface into the
specified mode.

If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled

auto-negotiation, and the value of this object
denotes the mode to which the interface will
automatically revert if/when auto-negotiation is

object is incremented at most once per carrier
event, even if multiple symbol errors occur
during the carrier event.  This count does
not increment if a collision is present.

This counter is a 64 bit version of
dot3StatsSymbolErrors.  It should be used on
interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s or faster.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
occur at re-initialization of the management
system, and at other times as indicated by the
value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document

repeatedly by other MIB objects.  Any implementation implementing
objects that use one of these definitions must follow its DESCRIPTION
clause as well as the DESCRIPTION clause of the object itself.
