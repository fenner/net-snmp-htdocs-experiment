<pre>
The public Diffie-Hellman parameters for doing a Diffie-Hellman
key agreement for this device.  This is encoded as an ASN.1
DHParameter per PKCS #3, section 9.  E.g.

    DHParameter ::= SEQUENCE {
       prime   INTEGER,   -- p
       base    INTEGER,   -- g
       privateValueLength  INTEGER OPTIONAL }

Implementors are encouraged to use either the values from
Oakley Group 1  or the values of from Oakley Group 2 as specified
in RFC-2409, The Internet Key Exchange, Section 6.1, 6.2 as the
default for this object.  Other values may be used, but the
security properties of those values MUST be well understood and
MUST meet the requirements of PKCS #3 for the selection of
Diffie-Hellman primes.

    In addition, any time usmDHParameters changes, all values of
type DHKeyChange will change and new random numbers MUST be
generated by the agent for each DHKeyChange object.

<pre>
A table of mappings between zero or more Diffie-Helman key
agreement values and entries in the usmUserTable.  Entries in this
table are created by providing the associated device with a
Diffie-Helman public value and a usmUserName/usmUserSecurityName
pair during initialization. How these values are provided is
outside the scope of this MIB, but could be provided manually, or
through a configuration file.  Valid public value/name pairs
result in the creation of a row in this table as well as the
creation of an associated row (with keys derived as indicated) in
the usmUserTable.  The actual access the related usmSecurityName
has is dependent on the entries in the VACM tables.  In general,
an implementor will specify one or more standard security names
and will provide entries in the VACM tables granting various
levels of access to those names.  The actual content of the VACM

table is beyond the scope of this MIB.

Note: This table is expected to be readable without authentication
using the usmUserSecurityName 'dhKickstart'.  See the conformance
statements for details.

<pre>
The agent's Diffie-Hellman public value for this row.  At
initialization, the agent generates a random number and derives
    its public value from that number.  This public value is published
    here.  This public value 'y' equals g^r MOD p where g is the from
    the set of Diffie-Hellman parameters, p is the prime from those
    parameters, and r is a random integer selected by the agent in the
    interval 2^(l-1) <= r < p-1 < 2^l.  If l is unspecified, then r is
    a random integer selected in the interval 0 <= r < p-1
The public value is expressed as an OCTET STRING 'PV' of length
    'k' which satisfies
          k
        y =  SUM   2^(8(k-i)) PV'i
             i = 1
    where PV1,...,PVk are the octets of PV from first to last, and
        where PV1 != 0.
The following DH parameters (Oakley group #2, RFC 2409, sec 6.1,
    6.2) are used for this object:

<pre>
The manager's Diffie-Hellman public value for this row.  Note
that this value is not set via the SNMP agent, but may be set via
some out of band method, such as the device's configuration file.

The manager calculates this value in the same manner and using the
same parameter set as the agent does.  E.g. it selects a random
number 'r', calculates y = g^r mod p and provides 'y' as the
public number expressed as an OCTET STRING.  See
usmDHKickstartMyPublic for details.

When this object is set with a valid value during initialization,
a row is created in the usmUserTable with the following values:

usmUserEngineID             localEngineID
usmUserName                 [value of usmDHKickstartSecurityName]
usmUserSecurityName         [value of usmDHKickstartSecurityName]
usmUserCloneFrom            ZeroDotZero
usmUserAuthProtocol         usmHMACMD5AuthProtocol
usmUserAuthKeyChange        -- derived from set value
usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange     -- derived from set value
usmUserPrivProtocol         usmDESPrivProtocol
usmUserPrivKeyChange        -- derived from set value
usmUserOwnPrivKeyChange     -- derived from set value
usmUserPublic               ''
usmUserStorageType          permanent
usmUserStatus               active

A shared secret 'sk' is calculated at the agent as sk =
mgrPublic^r mod p where r is the agents random number and p is the
DH prime from the common parameters.  The underlying privacy key
for this row is derived from sk by applying the key derivation
function PBKDF2 defined in PKCS#5v2.0 with a salt of 0xd1310ba6,
and iterationCount of 500, a keyLength of 16 (for
usmDESPrivProtocol), and a prf (pseudo random function) of
'id-hmacWithSHA1'.  The underlying authentication key for this row
is derived from sk by applying the key derivation function PBKDF2
with a salt of 0x98dfb5ac , an interation count of 500, a
keyLength of 16 (for usmHMAC5AuthProtocol), and a prf of
'id-hmacWithSHA1'.  Note: The salts are the first two words in the
ks0 [key schedule 0] of the BLOWFISH cipher from 'Applied
Cryptography' by Bruce Schnier - they could be any relatively
random string of bits.

The manager can use its knowledge of its own random number and the
agent's public value to kickstart its access to the agent in a
secure manner.  Note that the security of this approach is
directly related to the strength of the authorization security of
the out of band provisioning of the managers public value
(e.g. the configuration file), but is not dependent at all on the
strength of the confidentiality of the out of band provisioning
data.

These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document

<tr><td><a name="DHKeyChange">DHKeyChange</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>Upon initialization, or upon creation of a row containing an
object of this type, and after any successful SET of this value, a
GET of this value returns 'y' where y = g^xa MOD p, and where g is
the base from usmDHParameters, p is the prime from
usmDHParameters, and xa is a new random integer selected by the
agent in the interval 2^(l-1) <= xa < 2^l < p-1.  'l' is the
optional privateValueLength from usmDHParameters in bits.  If 'l'
is omitted, then xa (and xr below) is selected in the interval 0
<= xa < p-1.  y is expressed as an OCTET STRING 'PV' of length 'k'
which satisfies

          k
    y =  SUM   2^(8(k-i)) PV'i
         i=1

    where PV1,...,PVk are the octets of PV from first to last, and
    where PV1 <> 0.

A successful SET consists of the value 'y' expressed as an OCTET
STRING as above concatenated with the value 'z'(expressed as an
OCTET STRING in the same manner as y) where z = g^xr MOD p, where
g, p and l are as above, and where xr is a new random integer
selected by the manager in the interval 2^(l-1) <= xr < 2^l <
p-1. A SET to an object of this type will fail with the error
wrongValue if the current 'y' does not match the 'y' portion of
the value of the varbind for the object. (E.g. GET yout, SET
concat(yin, z), yout <> yin).

Note that the private values xa and xr are never transmitted from
manager to device or vice versa, only the values y and z.
Obviously, these values must be retained until a successful SET on
the associated object.

The shared secret 'sk' is calculated at the agent as sk = z^xa MOD
p, and at the manager as sk = y^xr MOD p.

Each object definition of this type MUST describe how to map from
the shared secret 'sk' to the operational key value used by the
protocols and operations related to the object.  In general, if n
bits of key are required, the author suggests using the n
right-most bits of the shared secret as the operational key value.</pre></td></tr>

Objects of this type are for identification, not for
addressing, even though it is possible that an
address may have been used in the generation of
a specific value.

The value for this object may not be all zeros or
all 'ff'H or the empty (zero length) string.

The initial value for this object may be configured
via an operator console entry or via an algorithmic
function.  In the latter case, the following
example algorithm is recommended.

In cases where there are multiple engines on the
same system, the use of this algorithm is NOT
appropriate, as it would result in all of those
engines ending up with the same ID value.

1) The very first bit is used to indicate how the
   rest of the data is composed.

   0 - as defined by enterprise using former methods
       that existed before SNMPv3. See item 2 below.

   1 - as defined by this architecture, see item 3
       below.

   Note that this allows existing uses of the
   engineID (also known as AgentID [RFC1910]) to
   co-exist with any new uses.

2) The snmpEngineID has a length of 12 octets.

   The first four octets are set to the binary
   equivalent of the agent's SNMP management
   private enterprise number as assigned by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
   For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned
   { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would
   be assigned '000002b8'H.

   The remaining eight octets are determined via
   one or more enterprise-specific methods. Such
   methods must be designed so as to maximize the
   possibility that the value of this object will
   be unique in the agent's administrative domain.
   For example, it may be the IP address of the SNMP
   entity, or the MAC address of one of the
   interfaces, with each address suitably padded
   with random octets.  If multiple methods are
   defined, then it is recommended that the first
   octet indicate the method being used and the
   remaining octets be a function of the method.

3) The length of the octet string varies.

   The first four octets are set to the binary
   equivalent of the agent's SNMP management
   private enterprise number as assigned by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
   For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned
   { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would
   be assigned '000002b8'H.

   The very first bit is set to 1. For example, the
   above value for Acme Networks now changes to be
   '800002b8'H.

   The fifth octet indicates how the rest (6th and
   following octets) are formatted. The values for
   the fifth octet are:

     0     - reserved, unused.

     1     - IPv4 address (4 octets)
             lowest non-special IP address

     2     - IPv6 address (16 octets)
             lowest non-special IP address

     3     - MAC address (6 octets)

<tr><td><a name="SnmpAdminString">SnmpAdminString</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing administrative
information, preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this
information is represented using the ISO/IEC
IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
string using the UTF-8 transformation format
described in [RFC2279].

Since additional code points are added by
amendments to the 10646 standard from time
to time, implementations must be prepared to
encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
code point or are outside this range are
prohibited.

The use of control codes should be avoided.

When it is necessary to represent a newline,
the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

The use of leading or trailing white space should
be avoided.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative
means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
may be provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
single character / code point; thus the length
of this object in octets may be different from
the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
size constraints refer to the number of encoded
octets, not the number of characters represented
by an encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
[RFC3416].

Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
measured in octets, not characters.
