<h2>TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS</h2>

<p>
These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document
above.  They are SNMP's way of defining a datatype that is used
repeatedly by other MIB objects.  Any implementation implementing
objects that use one of these definitions must follow its DESCRIPTION
clause as well as the DESCRIPTION clause of the object itself.

A
row which is volatile(2) is lost upon reboot.  A row which
is either nonVolatile(3), permanent(4) or readOnly(5), is
backed up by stable storage.  A row which is permanent(4)
can be changed but not deleted.  A row which is readOnly(5)
cannot be changed nor deleted.

If the value of an object with this syntax is either
permanent(4) or readOnly(5), it cannot be written.
Conversely, if the value is either other(1), volatile(2) or
nonVolatile(3), it cannot be modified to be permanent(4) or
readOnly(5).  (All illegal modifications result in a
'wrongValue' error.)

Every usage of this textual convention is required to
specify the columnar objects which a permanent(4) row must
at a minimum allow to be writable.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpTagValue">SnmpTagValue</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing a tag value.
Tag values are preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this information
is represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character
set, encoded as an octet string using the UTF-8
character encoding scheme described in RFC 2279.

Since additional code points are added by amendments
to the 10646 standard from time to time,
implementations must be prepared to encounter any code
point from 0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff.

The use of control codes should be avoided, and certain

control codes are not allowed as described below.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative means
of entry and display, such as hexadecimal, may be
provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII, the UTF-8
representation is identical to the US-ASCII encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then a
SIZE restriction must be specified so that the number
of sub-identifiers for any object instance does not
exceed the limit of 128, as defined by [RFC1905].

An object of this type contains a single tag value
which is used to select a set of entries in a table.

A tag value is an arbitrary string of octets, but
may not contain a delimiter character.  Delimiter
characters are defined to be one of the following:

    -  An ASCII space character (0x20).

    -  An ASCII TAB character (0x09).

    -  An ASCII carriage return (CR) character (0x0D).

    -  An ASCII line feed (LF) character (0x0A).

Delimiter characters are used to separate tag values
in a tag list.  An object of this type may only
contain a single tag value, and so delimiter
characters are not allowed in a value of this type.

Note that a tag value of 0 length means that no tag is
defined.  In other words, a tag value of 0 length would
never match anything in a tag list, and would never
select any table entries.

Some examples of valid tag values are:

    - 'acme'

    - 'router'

    - 'host'

The use of a tag value to select table entries is
application and MIB specific.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpEngineID">SnmpEngineID</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An SNMP engine's administratively-unique identifier.
Objects of this type are for identification, not for
addressing, even though it is possible that an
address may have been used in the generation of
a specific value.

The value for this object may not be all zeros or
all 'ff'H or the empty (zero length) string.

The initial value for this object may be configured
via an operator console entry or via an algorithmic
function.  In the latter case, the following
example algorithm is recommended.

In cases where there are multiple engines on the
same system, the use of this algorithm is NOT
appropriate, as it would result in all of those
engines ending up with the same ID value.

1) The very first bit is used to indicate how the
   rest of the data is composed.

   0 - as defined by enterprise using former methods
       that existed before SNMPv3. See item 2 below.

   1 - as defined by this architecture, see item 3
       below.

   Note that this allows existing uses of the
   engineID (also known as AgentID [RFC1910]) to
   co-exist with any new uses.

2) The snmpEngineID has a length of 12 octets.

   The first four octets are set to the binary
   equivalent of the agent's SNMP management
   private enterprise number as assigned by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
   For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned
   { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would
   be assigned '000002b8'H.

   The remaining eight octets are determined via
   one or more enterprise-specific methods. Such
   methods must be designed so as to maximize the
   possibility that the value of this object will
   be unique in the agent's administrative domain.
   For example, it may be the IP address of the SNMP
   entity, or the MAC address of one of the
   interfaces, with each address suitably padded
   with random octets.  If multiple methods are
   defined, then it is recommended that the first
   octet indicate the method being used and the
   remaining octets be a function of the method.

3) The length of the octet string varies.

   The first four octets are set to the binary
   equivalent of the agent's SNMP management
   private enterprise number as assigned by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
   For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned
   { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would
   be assigned '000002b8'H.

   The very first bit is set to 1. For example, the
   above value for Acme Networks now changes to be
   '800002b8'H.

   The fifth octet indicates how the rest (6th and
   following octets) are formatted. The values for
   the fifth octet are:

     0     - reserved, unused.

     1     - IPv4 address (4 octets)
             lowest non-special IP address

     2     - IPv6 address (16 octets)
             lowest non-special IP address

     3     - MAC address (6 octets)
             lowest IEEE MAC address, canonical
             order

<tr><td><a name="RowStatus">RowStatus</td><td>INTEGER<table class="enums"><tr><th>Value</th><th>Label/Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>notInService</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>notReady</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>createAndGo</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>createAndWait</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>destroy</td></tr></table></td><td><pre>The RowStatus textual convention is used to manage the
creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus
     value, the column in question may be changed if the
     RowStatus was not equal to `active' as the PDU was
     received, or if the varbind sets the status</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpAdminString">SnmpAdminString</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing administrative
information, preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this
information is represented using the ISO/IEC
IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
string using the UTF-8 transformation format
described in [RFC2279].

Since additional code points are added by
amendments to the 10646 standard from time
to time, implementations must be prepared to
encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
code point or are outside this range are
prohibited.

The use of control codes should be avoided.

When it is necessary to represent a newline,
the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

The use of leading or trailing white space should
be avoided.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative
means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
may be provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
single character / code point; thus the length
of this object in octets may be different from
the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
size constraints refer to the number of encoded
octets, not the number of characters represented
by an encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
[RFC3416].

Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
measured in octets, not characters.
