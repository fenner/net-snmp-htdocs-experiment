<pre>
A table containing information on the relationships between
the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces.  In
          particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run
          'underneath' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer
          corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.  For
          example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs
          underneath the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this
          table contains:
  ifInvStackStatus.x.y=active
For each ifIndex value, z, which identifies an active
          interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows
          in this table associated with z.  For one of these rows, z
          is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, z is the
          value of ifStackLowerLayer.  (If z is not involved in
          multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated
          with z.)
For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has
          no others stacked on top or below it:
  ifInvStackStatus.z.0=active
            ifInvStackStatus.0.z=active
This table contains exactly the same number of rows as the
          ifStackTable, but the rows appear in a different order.

The status of the relationship between two sub-layers.
An instance of this object exists for each instance of the
          ifStackStatus object, and vice versa.  For example, if the
          variable ifStackStatus.H.L exists, then the variable
          ifInvStackStatus.L.H must also exist, and vice versa.  In
          addition, the two variables always have the same value.
However, unlike ifStackStatus, the ifInvStackStatus object
          is NOT write-able.  A network management application wishing
          to change a relationship between sub-layers H and L cannot
          do so by modifying the value of ifInvStackStatus.L.H, but
          must instead modify the value of ifStackStatus.H.L.  After
          the ifStackTable is modified, the change will be reflected
          in this table.

<h2>TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<p>
These TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS are used in other parts of the document
above.  They are SNMP's way of defining a datatype that is used
repeatedly by other MIB objects.  Any implementation implementing
objects that use one of these definitions must follow its DESCRIPTION
clause as well as the DESCRIPTION clause of the object itself.

creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus
     value, the column in question may be changed if the
     RowStatus was not equal to `active' as the PDU was
     received, or if the varbind sets the status</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="InterfaceIndexOrZero">InterfaceIndexOrZero</td><td>INTEGER32</td><td><pre>This textual convention is an extension of the
InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a greater
than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
sub-layer in the managed system.  This extension permits the
additional value of zero.  the value zero is object-specific
and must therefore be defined as part of the description of
any object which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
zero might include situations where interface was unknown,
or when none or all interfaces need to be referenced.</pre></td></tr>
