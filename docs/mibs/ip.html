This table allows the user to determine the source of an IP
address or set of IP addresses, and allows other tables to
share the information via pointer rather than by copying.

For example, when the node configures both a unicast and
anycast address for a prefix, the ipAddressPrefix objects
for those addresses will point to a single row in this
table.

This table primarily provides support for IPv6 prefixes, and
several of the objects are less meaningful for IPv4.  The
table continues to allow IPv4 addresses to allow future
flexibility.  In order to promote a common configuration,
this document includes suggestions for default values for
IPv4 prefixes.  Each of these values may be overridden if an
object is meaningful to the node.

All prefixes used by this entity should be included in this
table independent of how the entity learned the prefix.
(This table isn't limited to prefixes learned from router

advertisements.)

This table contains addressing information relevant to the

This table does not contain multicast address information.
Tables for such information should be contained in multicast

While this table is writable, the user will note that
several objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, are not.  The
intention in allowing a user to write to this table is to
allow them to add or remove any entry that isn't

permanent.  The user should be allowed to modify objects
and entries when that would not cause inconsistencies
within the table.  Allowing write access to objects, such
as ipAddressOrigin, could allow a user to insert an entry
and then label it incorrectly.

Note well: When including IPv6 link-local addresses in this
table, the entry must use an InetAddressType of 'ipv6z' in
order to differentiate between the possible interfaces.

The type of mapping.
Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect
            of invalidating the corresponding entry in the
            ipNetToPhysicalTable.  That is, it effectively dis-
            associates the interface identified with said entry from the
            mapping identified with said entry.  It is an
            implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent
removes an invalidated entry from the table.  Accordingly,
            management stations must be prepared to receive tabular
            information from agents that corresponds to entries not
            currently in use.  Proper interpretation of such entries
            requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType
            object.
The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to
            physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved
            using e.g., IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
            protocol.
The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been
            statically configured.  Both of these refer to entries that
            provide mappings for other entities addresses.
The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided
            for an entity's own interface address.
As the entries in this table are typically not persistent
            when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the
            change to non-volatile storage.

An InetAddressPrefixLength value is always interpreted within
the context of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the
InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention is required to
specify the InetAddressType object that provides the
context.  It is suggested that the InetAddressType object be
logically registered before the object(s) that use the
InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention, if they appear
in the same logical row.

InetAddressPrefixLength values larger than
the maximum length of an IP address for a specific
InetAddressType are treated as the maximum significant
value applicable for the InetAddressType.  The maximum
significant value is 32 for the InetAddressType
'ipv4(1)' and 'ipv4z(3)' and 128 for the InetAddressType
'ipv6(2)' and 'ipv6z(4)'.  The maximum significant value
for the InetAddressType 'dns(16)' is 0.

The value zero is object-specific and must be defined as
part of the description of any object that uses this

situations where the Internet network address prefix

creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus

ipv4(1)     The IPv4 protocol as defined in RFC 791 (STD 5).
ipv6(2)     The IPv6 protocol as defined in RFC 2460.
Note that this textual convention SHOULD NOT be used to
         distinguish different address types associated with IP
         protocols.  The InetAddressType has been designed for this
         purpose.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="TimeStamp">TimeStamp</td><td>TICKS</td><td><pre>The value of the sysUpTime object at which a specific
occurrence happened.  The specific occurrence must be

defined in the description of any object defined using this
type.

If sysUpTime is reset to zero as a result of a re-
initialization of the network management (sub)system, then
the values of all TimeStamp objects are also reset.
However, after approximately 497 days without a re-
initialization, the sysUpTime object will reach 2^^32-1 and
then increment around to zero; in this case, existing values
of TimeStamp objects do not change.  This can lead to
ambiguities in the value of TimeStamp objects.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="InterfaceIndex">InterfaceIndex</td><td>INTEGER32</td><td><pre>A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface or
interface sub-layer in the managed system.  It is
recommended that values are assigned contiguously starting
from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer must remain
constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
network management system to the next re-initialization.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="InetAddress">InetAddress</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>Denotes a generic Internet address.
An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the context
         of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the InetAddress
         textual convention is required to specify the InetAddressType
         object that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
         InetAddressType object be logically registered before the
         object(s) that use the InetAddress textual convention, if
         they appear in the same logical row.
The value of an InetAddress object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated InetAddressType
         object.  Attempts to set an InetAddress object to a value
         inconsistent with the associated InetAddressType
         must fail with an inconsistentValue error.
When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to
         limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;
         otherwise the applicable constraints MUST be stated in
         the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or
         in the surrounding documentation if there is no single
         DESCRIPTION clause that is appropriate.</pre></td></tr>

manual(2) indicates a prefix that was manually configured.
wellknown(3) indicates a well-known prefix, e.g., 169.254/16
            for IPv4 auto-configuration or fe80::/10 for IPv6 link-local
            addresses.  Well known prefixes may be assigned by IANA,
            the address registries, or by specification in a standards
            track RFC.
dhcp(4) indicates a prefix that was assigned by a DHCP
            server.
routeradv(5) indicates a prefix learned from a router
            advertisement.
Note: while IpAddressOriginTC and IpAddressPrefixOriginTC
            are similar, they are not identical.  The first defines how
            an address was created, while the second defines how a

A
row which is volatile(2) is lost upon reboot.  A row which
is either nonVolatile(3), permanent(4) or readOnly(5), is
backed up by stable storage.  A row which is permanent(4)
can be changed but not deleted.  A row which is readOnly(5)
cannot be changed nor deleted.

If the value of an object with this syntax is either
permanent(4) or readOnly(5), it cannot be written.
Conversely, if the value is either other(1), volatile(2) or
nonVolatile(3), it cannot be modified to be permanent(4) or
readOnly(5).  (All illegal modifications result in a
'wrongValue' error.)

ifDescr.3 would be used instead).</pre></td></tr>
