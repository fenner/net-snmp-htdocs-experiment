<pre>
An advisory lock used to allow cooperating SNMP
Command Generator applications to coordinate their
use of the Set operation in creating or modifying
views.

When creating a new view or altering an existing
view, it is important to understand the potential
interactions with other uses of the view.  The
vacmViewSpinLock should be retrieved.  The name of
the view to be created should be determined to be
unique by the SNMP Command Generator application by
consulting the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable.  Finally,
the named view may be created (Set), including the
advisory lock.
If another SNMP Command Generator application has
altered the views in the meantime, then the spin
lock's value will have changed, and so this creation
will fail because it will specify the wrong value for
the spin lock.

Since this is an advisory lock, the use of this lock
is not enforced.

<pre>
The table of locally available contexts.
This table provides information to SNMP Command
Generator applications so that they can properly
                 configure the vacmAccessTable to control access to
                 all contexts at the SNMP entity.
This table may change dynamically if the SNMP entity
                 allows that contexts are added/deleted dynamically
                 (for instance when its configuration changes).  Such
                 changes would happen only if the management
                 instrumentation at that SNMP entity recognizes more
                 (or fewer) contexts.
The presence of entries in this table and of entries
                 in the vacmAccessTable are independent.  That is, a
                 context identified by an entry in this table is not
                 necessarily referenced by any entries in the
                 vacmAccessTable; and the context(s) referenced by an
                 entry in the vacmAccessTable does not necessarily
                 currently exist and thus need not be identified by an
                 entry in this table.
This table must be made accessible via the default
                 context so that Command Responder applications have
                 a standard way of retrieving the information.
This table is read-only.  It cannot be configured via
                 SNMP.

<pre>
The table of access rights for groups.
Each entry is indexed by a groupName, a contextPrefix,
                 a securityModel and a securityLevel.  To determine
                 whether access is allowed, one entry from this table
                 needs to be selected and the proper viewName from that
                 entry must be used for access control checking.
To select the proper entry, follow these steps:
1) the set of possible matches is formed by the
                    intersection of the following sets of entries:
     the set of entries with identical vacmGroupName
                      the union of these two sets:
                       - the set with identical vacmAccessContextPrefix
                       - the set of entries with vacmAccessContextMatch
                         value of 'prefix' and matching
                         vacmAccessContextPrefix
                      intersected with the union of these two sets:
                       - the set of entries with identical
                         vacmSecurityModel
                       - the set of entries with vacmSecurityModel
                         value of 'any'
                      intersected with the set of entries with
                      vacmAccessSecurityLevel value less than or equal
                      to the requested securityLevel
2) if this set has only one member, we're done
                    otherwise, it comes down to deciding how to weight
                    the preferences between ContextPrefixes,
                    SecurityModels, and SecurityLevels as follows:
                    a) if the subset of entries with securityModel
                       matching the securityModel in the message is
                       not empty, then discard the rest.
                    b) if the subset of entries with
                       vacmAccessContextPrefix matching the contextName
                       in the message is not empty,
                       then discard the rest
                    c) discard all entries with ContextPrefixes shorter
                       than the longest one remaining in the set
                    d) select the entry with the highest securityLevel
Please note that for securityLevel noAuthNoPriv, all
                 groups are really equivalent since the assumption that
                 the securityName has been authenticated does not hold.

<pre>
Locally held information about families of subtrees
within MIB views.

Each MIB view is defined by two sets of view subtrees:
  - the included view subtrees, and
  - the excluded view subtrees.
Every such view subtree, both the included and the

excluded ones, is defined in this table.

To determine if a particular object instance is in
a particular MIB view, compare the object instance's
OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active
entries in this table.  If none match, then the
object instance is not in the MIB view.  If one or
more match, then the object instance is included in,
or excluded from, the MIB view according to the
value of vacmViewTreeFamilyType in the entry whose
value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree has the most
sub-identifiers.  If multiple entries match and have
the same number of sub-identifiers (when wildcarding
is specified with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask),
then the lexicographically greatest instance of
vacmViewTreeFamilyType determines the inclusion or
exclusion.

An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an
active entry in this table when the number of
sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree for the entry,
and each sub-identifier in the value of
vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree matches its corresponding
sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-identifiers match
either if the corresponding bit of the value of
vacmViewTreeFamilyMask for the entry is zero (the
'wild card' value), or if they are equal.

A 'family' of subtrees is the set of subtrees defined
by a particular combination of values of
vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask.

In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in the
vacmViewTreeFamilyMask, the family of subtrees reduces
to a single subtree.

When creating or changing MIB views, an SNMP Command
Generator application should utilize the
vacmViewSpinLock to try to avoid collisions.  See
DESCRIPTION clause of vacmViewSpinLock.

When creating MIB views, it is strongly advised that
first the 'excluded' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are
created and then the 'included' entries.

When deleting MIB views, it is strongly advised that
first the 'included' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are

deleted and then the 'excluded' entries.

If a create for an entry for instance-level access
control is received and the implementation does not
support instance-level granularity, then an
inconsistentName error must be returned.

<pre>
The bit mask which, in combination with the
corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
defines a family of view subtrees.

Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
sub-identifier of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, with the
most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
string value (extended if necessary, see below)
corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for
each sub-identifier of the value of
vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, either:

  the i-th bit of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask is 0, or

  the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
  sub-identifier of the value of
  vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and

there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
required length.

Note that when the value of this object is the
zero-length string, this extension rule results in
a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),
and the family of view subtrees is the one view
subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding
instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

Note that masks of length greater than zero length
do not need to be supported.  In this case this
object is made read-only.

<tr><td><a name="SnmpSecurityModel">SnmpSecurityModel</td><td>INTEGER</td><td><pre>An identifier that uniquely identifies a
Security Model of the Security Subsystem within
this SNMP Management Architecture.

The values for securityModel are allocated as
follows:

- The zero value does not identify any particular
  security model.

- Values between 1 and 255, inclusive, are reserved
  for standards-track Security Models and are
  managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
  (IANA).
- Values greater than 255 are allocated to
  enterprise-specific Security Models.  An
  enterprise-specific securityModel value is defined
  to be:

  enterpriseID * 256 + security model within
  enterprise

  For example, the fourth Security Model defined by
  the enterprise whose enterpriseID is 1 would be
  259.

This scheme for allocation of securityModel
values allows for a maximum of 255 standards-
based Security Models, and for a maximum of
256 Security Models per enterprise.

It is believed that the assignment of new
securityModel values will be rare in practice
because the larger the number of simultaneously
utilized Security Models, the larger the
chance that interoperability will suffer.
Consequently, it is believed that such a range
will be sufficient.  In the unlikely event that
the standards committee finds this number to be
insufficient over time, an enterprise number
can be allocated to obtain an additional 256
possible values.

Note that the most significant bit must be zero;
hence, there are 23 bits allocated for various
organizations to design and define non-standard

securityModels.  This limits the ability to
define new proprietary implementations of Security
Models to the first 8,388,608 enterprises.

It is worthwhile to note that, in its encoded
form, the securityModel value will normally
require only a single byte since, in practice,
the leftmost bits will be zero for most messages
and sign extension is suppressed by the encoding
rules.

As of this writing, there are several values
of securityModel defined for use with SNMP or
reserved for use with supporting MIB objects.
They are as follows:

    0  reserved for 'any'
    1  reserved for SNMPv1
    2  reserved for SNMPv2c
    3  User-Based Security Model (USM)

creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus
     value, the column in question may be changed if the
     RowStatus was not equal to `active' as the PDU was
     received, or if the varbind sets the status</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="SnmpAdminString">SnmpAdminString</td><td>OCTETSTR</td><td><pre>An octet string containing administrative
information, preferably in human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this
information is represented using the ISO/IEC
IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
string using the UTF-8 transformation format
described in [RFC2279].

Since additional code points are added by
amendments to the 10646 standard from time
to time, implementations must be prepared to
encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
code point or are outside this range are
prohibited.

The use of control codes should be avoided.

When it is necessary to represent a newline,
the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

The use of leading or trailing white space should
be avoided.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative
means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
may be provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
single character / code point; thus the length
of this object in octets may be different from
the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
size constraints refer to the number of encoded
octets, not the number of characters represented
by an encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object that
is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
[RFC3416].

Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
measured in octets, not characters.
